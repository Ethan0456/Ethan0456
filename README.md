# Hello There! 🌟
I’m Abhijeetsingh Meena, a Machine Learning Engineer at [OpenLocus](https://openlocus.ai/). My work focuses on exploring new technologies and contributing to advancements in AI.

### 🚀 Passionate About
My primary interests include Large Generative Models and their applications in Agentic Systems and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I'm particularly interested in the potential of these technologies to advance scientific discovery and solve real-world problems.

### 🔭 Current Focus
I'm currently researching autonomous agents and their applications in scientific discovery and industry. My work involves developing solutions that use large generative models to improve scientific discovery and problem-solving capabilities.

### 📚 Authored Papers & Contributions
- DiscoveryBench: Towards Data-Driven Discovery with Large Language Models - [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01725v1)
- Data-driven Discovery with Large Generative Models: Accepted at ICML'24 - [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13610)

### 🛰️ DiscoveryBench
Each DiscoveryBench task consists of a goal and dataset(s). Solving the task requires both statistical analysis and scientific semantic reasoning. The realistic requirement of domain-specific tools in some tasks adds more complexity. An ideal discovery agent should implement discovery programs in Python.
