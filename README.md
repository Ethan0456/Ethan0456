# Hello There! 🌟
I’m Abhijeetsingh Meena, a Machine Learning Engineer at [OpenLocus](https://openlocus.ai/). I build agentic systems at scale that solve data-driven scientific discovery problems.

### 🚀 Passionate About
My primary interests include Large Generative Models and their applications in Agentic Systems and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I'm particularly interested in the potential of these technologies to advance data-driven discovery and solve real-world problems.

### 🔭 Current Focus
I'm currently researching autonomous agents and their applications in scientific discovery and industry. My work involves developing solutions that use large generative models to improve scientific discovery and problem-solving capabilities.
